Contact lists and Blacklist
===========================
Creating your own list of contacts, or importing it, is useful when you want to create specific
groups of people, such as the subscribers of your newsletter. It is also the best way to get started
if you are coming from another system and already have built an audience. It makes the SMS
distribution a lot easier.


Contact lists
=============
| Go to :menuselection:`Contacts lists --> Contacts lists --> Create`.
| Choose a name for your *Mailing list*, and activate the option *Public* if you would like to make
  the mailing list accessible to your recipients in the unsubscription page to allow them to update
  their subscription preferences.
| Once inside the list, you can again *Create* or *Import* contacts for that specific list.

History with the Log Notes
--------------------------
A record of the mailings sent is kept in the chatter of the recipient (whether it is a contact or
an opportunity, for example).

| This is important as you and your team can easily keep track and see a history of interactions
  with your contacts or prospects, granting you the ability to better understand them.
| Example: your sales representative can easily find out which SMS mailing promotions a customer has
  received or not.


Blacklist
=========
| If you are coming from another software and have a list of clients who have already asked to be
  blacklisted, you can import those entries in your database.
| For that, go to :menuselection:`Configuration --> Phone Blacklist --> Import`.
